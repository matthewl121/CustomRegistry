For example, for a given `List` component, I use these boolean attributes:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<List\r\n    useMenuForActions\r\n    hasSearch\r\n    expandable\r\n/>\r\n```\r\n\r\nI see no warning in the console.\r\n\r\nBut when I write this code:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<td ltr>{entity.phoneNumber}</td>\r\n```\r\n\r\nI see this warning:\r\n\r\n> Warning: Received `true` for a non-boolean attribute `ltr`.\r\n> If you want to write it to the DOM, pass a string instead: ltr=\"true\" or ltr={value.toString()}.\r\n\r\nIn both cases, I read the *boolean attribute* from `props` and act accordingly if they are present (which means they are true).\r\nThen only difference is that for the second one (the `<td>` element) I use `React.Children` and `map` to transform them.\r\nI checked and `ltr` is not a standard HTML attribute.\r\n\r\nReact version: 18.3.1\r\n\r\n## Steps To Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Create a react project\r\n2. Create a component with a custom boolean attribute (do anything you want with it)\r\n3. Create a simple HTML element with a custom boolean attribute (use it in `React.Children` method to add a simple custom style for example)\r\n4. Render both of them\r\n5. You should see a warning for the second case\r\n\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/brave-fast-5s9xxs\r\n\r\n## The current behavior\r\nWarning on 'ltr'\r\n\r\n## The expected behavior\r\nNo warning should be shown",

You may provide a screenshot of the application if you think it is\r\n  relevant to your bug report. Here are some tips for providing a minimal\r\n  example: https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## The current behavior\r\nReact will render with the second state update first (\"bar\"), and then re-render with the first update (\"foo\"). This only happens when the awaited function returns immediately. If the awaited promise resolves at a later time, the state is updated in the expected order.\r\n\r\nIn the example, you can observe this happening by clicking the button and looking at the console (\"BUG RENDERED!!!😱😱😱\"), or by seeing a brief flash of red on the component as it renders inaccurately. The console message triggers every time, the red flash only occurs occasionally. In our actual app we're seeing the render occur every time. \r\n\r\nIf you adjust the example to instead call `await optionalDelay(true)`, the state updates will be applied in order and the component will flash green.\r\n\r\n## The expected behavior\r\nThe state updates should be applied in the order as specified in the code. This was the behavior in React 16, which can be tested in the sandbox.\r\n\r\nThis appears to be fixed in React 19.0.0-rc.0.\r\n\r\nPreviously reported in:\r\n* #25129, which has a wonderfully concise repro https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/cocky-fermat-qoiel3.\r\n* #24649, where this was mentioned as a [known issue](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/24649#issuecomment-1511754282) but no tracking issue was given.\r\n",

I found that the suspense will show the fallback if the call to `use()` is delayed, even if the promise already resolved prior to `use`ing it. Namely, Suspense always renders the fallback initially, even if the component never suspends. \r\n\r\nInterestingly, if I `use` the promise in a sibling component, this issue is not present even on the first suspense component.\r\n\r\n## Reproduction\r\n[Here's a minimal reproducible example](https://github.com/mordechaim/lazy-suspense).\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>Code backup</summary>\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n\r\nimport { Suspense, use, useMemo, useState } from 'react';\r\n\r\nexport function App() {\r\n  const [open, setOpen] = useState(false);\r\n\r\n  const promise = useMemo(\r\n    () =>\r\n      new Promise<string>((resolve) => {\r\n        console.log('starting promise');\r\n\r\n        setTimeout(() => {\r\n          console.log('resolving promise');\r\n\r\n          resolve('hello');\r\n        }, 5000);\r\n      }),\r\n    []\r\n  );\r\n\r\n  return (\r\n    <>\r\n      <div>\r\n        <button onClick={() => setOpen(true)}>Reveal</button>\r\n        {open && (\r\n          <Suspense fallback='still loading...'>\r\n            <SuspendableGreeting promise={promise} />\r\n          </Suspense>\r\n        )}\r\n      </div>\r\n\r\n      {/* Uncommenting the below code will fixed the issue above */}\r\n      {/* <Suspense fallback='loading'>\r\n        <Resolve promise={promise} />\r\n      </Suspense> */}\r\n    </>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n\r\ninterface SuspendableProps {\r\n  promise: Promise<string>;\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction SuspendableGreeting({ promise }: SuspendableProps) {\r\n  const greeting = use(promise);\r\n  return greeting;\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction Resolve({ promise }: SuspendableProps) {\r\n  use(promise);\r\n  return null;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.

Isn't there a way to make some syntax like\r\nconst value = useStateWithSetMethod('')\r\nvalue.set('this is it');// or .setValue or .setState\r\nReally, it is only matter of making a method instead of setFunction everytime with every state with different name. There is no need to give them a different name if it is setValue or setState method within state, cause you call it from a state which already has unique name.\r\nYou even don't have to add a new whole hook. Just make a wrapper around useState and call it new name like useStater. And that wont break anything cause there's no hook change or add. \r\nSomething like\r\nfunction useStater(ininitialValue) {\r\nconst [value, setValue] = useState(initialValue);\r\nvalue.setValue = setValue; //or .setState for better readibility\r\nreturn value;\r\n}\r\nI can do it in my own lib and doing right now, but it is easier and better DX to make it by default.

        "body": "**Description**:\r\nWhen using `useEffect` in React with a state variable in the dependency array and a `setTimeout` function inside the effect, the initial state update causes an unexpected jump from `0` to `2` within the first interval period. This behavior deviates from the expected incremental update and can lead to confusion and potential bugs.\r\n\r\n**Steps to Reproduce**:\r\n1. Create a component with the following code:\r\n    ```javascript\r\n    import { useState, useEffect } from \"react\";\r\n\r\n    function Temp() {\r\n      const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\r\n\r\n      useEffect(() => {\r\n        setTimeout(() => {\r\n          setCount((count) => count + 1);\r\n        }, 5000);\r\n      }, [count]);\r\n\r\n      return <h1>I've rendered {count} times!</h1>;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    export default Temp;\r\n    ```\r\n2. Render the `Temp` component.\r\n3. Observe the `count` value after the first timeout period (5 seconds).\r\n\r\n**Expected Behavior**:\r\nThe `count` should increment from `0` to `1` after the first 5-second interval and continue incrementing by `1` every subsequent 5-second interval.\r\n\r\n**Actual Behavior**:\r\nThe `count` jumps from `0` to `2` within the first 5-second interval, and then increments correctly by `1` every subsequent 5-second interval.\r\n\r\n**Explanation**:\r\nThis unexpected jump occurs due to the way React handles state updates and effect executions. Here’s a detailed breakdown:\r\n1. **Initial Render**:\r\n   - `count` is initialized to `0`.\r\n   - `useEffect` schedules a `setTimeout` to increment `count` after 5 seconds.\r\n\r\n2. **First Timeout Execution** (after 5 seconds):\r\n   - The `setTimeout` callback executes and increments `count` from `0` to `1`.\r\n   - This state change triggers a re-render of the component.\r\n   - `useEffect` runs again because `count` is in the dependency array, scheduling another `setTimeout` for 5 seconds.\r\n\r\n3. **State Update and Re-render**:\r\n   - React processes the state update, causing the component to re-render with `count` set to `1`.\r\n   - The re-render triggers `useEffect` again, scheduling another `setTimeout` almost immediately.\r\n\r\nReact batches state updates and effect re-runs to optimize performance. This batching can result in both the initial state update (from `0` to `1`) and the next `setTimeout` scheduling occurring within the same event loop tick. Consequently, the `setTimeout` callback executes twice in quick succession:\r\n1. The first `setTimeout` increments `count` from `0` to `1` after 5 seconds.\r\n2. The state update triggers a re-render, and `useEffect` schedules another `setTimeout` immediately due to the new `count` value (`1`).\r\n3. The second `setTimeout` increments `count` from `1` to `2` almost immediately.\r\n\r\n**Impact**:\r\n- **Developer Confusion**: The unexpected behavior can lead to confusion, especially for developers new to React or those expecting consistent interval updates.\r\n- **Potential Bugs**: Misunderstanding this behavior can lead to bugs in applications, particularly in scenarios requiring precise timing or consistent state updates.\r\n- **Increased Complexity**: Developers need to add additional logic to handle this case, increasing the complexity of the code.\r\n\r\n**Suggested Improvements**:\r\n1. **Documentation**: Enhance the React documentation to explicitly mention this behavior and provide guidelines on how to handle it.\r\n2. **Development Warnings**: Introduce development-time warnings for common patterns that might lead to this behavior, suggesting alternative patterns or solutions.\r\n3. **API Enhancements**: Consider API enhancements that provide a more intuitive handling of such scenarios, potentially through built-in mechanisms for managing intervals and timeouts predictably.\r\n\r\nI hope that by addressing this issue, you can make state updates and effect handling more intuitive and predictable, thereby enhancing the overall developer experience.",

I have done this using React.Children.map() and i check if the type of child is ChildComponent, then I clone it and inject update event handlers to the children.\r\nThe problem arise because ChildItemComponent needs ref to be passed into it and it is enclosed by forwardRef. This means I have no name to compare if the mapped component type is ChildItemComponent:\r\n```\r\nif (React.isValidElement<ChildItemComponentProps>(elm) && elm.type.toString() === ChildItemComponent.toString()) {\r\n        return React.cloneElement<ChildItemComponentProps>(child, { onChange: setActiveTabByClick });\r\n      }\r\n```\r\nAs you can see I am using `toString` method to make what I need but I expect it to have displayName, a more efficient way.

Refreshing My Website to view the SSR skeleton content，the link is https://jimeng.jianying.com/ai-tool/home\r\n3. Sometimes it works fined, but Sometimes the page become black  after SSR skeleton content（we can 4x slower cpu to meet this），I found it's because My SSR content inside \"div#root\" is removed by this code:\r\n![image](https://github.com/facebook/react/assets/22492458/e3ee2132-d190-4966-8908-9525b572c849)\r\n4. It seems that the fiber node has Snapshot(1024) flags, which should be \"Update\"（4）。I don't know the reason, and why sometimes it works fine, somethimes it works wrong\r\n5. the source code error stack is inside react repo: packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactFiberCommitWork.js，commitBeforeMutationEffectsOnFiber Function\r\n\r\nMore info: our project using ssr to show skeleton,  but we don't want \"hydrating\", our client side render will return \"null\" to skip react hydrating. \r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't\r\n  have dependencies other than React. Issues without reproduction steps or\r\n  code examples may be immediately closed as not actionable.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nLink to code example:\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  Please provide a CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new), a link to a\r\n  repository on GitHub, or provide a minimal code example that reproduces the\r\n  problem. You may provide a screenshot of the application if you think it is\r\n  relevant to your bug report. Here are some tips for providing a minimal\r\n  example: https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## The current behavior\r\nsomethimes the fiber node has flag \"Snapshot\"（1024）, which causing my ssr content is removed\r\n\r\n## The expected behavior\r\nthe fiber node's flag  is always \"Update\"（4）, which won't remove my ssr content \r\n",

Unknown. No rules of hooks are being broken and the error stack is not helpful for diagnosis.\r\n\r\n**Code example:**\r\n\r\nI don't know how to reproduce this. Originally I faced #22049, supposedly caused by our \"problem hook\":\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// Supposed problem hook\r\nconst linkableRef = useRef(linkable);\r\nuseEffect(() => {\r\n  linkableRef.current = linkable; // linkable is an array of objects\r\n  const { current: editor } = editorRef;\r\n  if (editor) editor.commands.updateLinkable();\r\n}, [linkable, editorRef]);\r\n```\r\n\r\nand removing the hook causes this instead: `Error: Should have a queue. This is likely a bug in React. Please file an issue.`\r\n\r\n## The current behavior\r\nUsing our simple hook causes #22049 - and removing our hook causes this issue instead\r\n\r\n## The expected behavior\r\nUsing React as specified in the docs causes no errors",

Please test using the latest version of the relevant\r\n  React packages to make sure your issue has not already been fixed.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nReact version: 18.2.0\r\n\r\n## Steps To Reproduce\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nimport React, { PureComponent, useCallback, useEffect } from 'react';\r\n\r\nexport function App(props) {\r\n  const refCallback = (ref) => {\r\n    console.log(\"Reference received\")\r\n  };\r\n\r\n  return (\r\n    <div ref={refCallback}>\r\n        <ClassComponent  />\r\n        <FunctionalComponent />\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass ClassComponent extends PureComponent {\r\n  componentDidMount() {\r\n    console.log(\"ClassComponent mounted\")\r\n  }\r\n  render() {\r\n    return \"ClassComponent\"\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction FunctionalComponent() {\r\n  useEffect(() => {\r\n    console.log(\"FunctionalComponent mounted\")\r\n  })\r\n  return \"FunctionalComponent\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't\r\n  have dependencies other than React. Issues without reproduction steps or\r\n  code examples may be immediately closed as not actionable.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nLink to code example: https://playcode.io/1905766\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  Please provide a CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new), a link to a\r\n  repository on GitHub, or provide a minimal code example that reproduces the\r\n  problem.

Here are some tips for providing a minimal\r\n  example: https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## The current behavior\r\n\r\nConsole logs:\r\n\r\n```\r\nClassComponent mounted\r\nReference received\r\nFunctionalComponent mounted\r\n```\r\n\r\n`ClassComponent` is mounted before reference is received. It's different if a functional component is used.\r\n\r\n## The expected behavior\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if this is expected behavior but I was expecting to receive a ref before components are mounted.\r\n\r\n```\r\nReference received\r\nClassComponent mounted\r\nFunctionalComponent mounted\r\n```",

By clicking the `Re-fetch` button, the list being normal with 3 items. But I noticed that not matter if its strict mode, the list was replaced twice by checking console logs that the `console.log` in then clause are called twice and the list also changes twice with a quick flash of 6 items then showing the expected 3 items.\r\n\r\n\r\n## The expected behavior\r\nThe initial list should only show 3 items and clicking the `Re-fetch` button shouldn't make the element flickering.",

Please test using the latest version of the relevant\r\n  React packages to make sure your issue has not already been fixed.\r\n-->\r\nI have a nextjs application that have to render a json-ld schema. The easiest place to generate the schema was in a page component responsible for loading product. I though using the [special rendering behaviour of scripts](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/components/script#special-rendering-behavior) will move the`<script>` tag from the `<body>` into the `<head>` section. I was testing with postman because I wanted to see only the initial version of the page and be sure that the script element is in the `<head>` section. Which wasn't. The problem was a client component that was rendering a loading screen and preventing everything underneath to be rendered on the server. I thought this is safe for now and tried to run the code in the browser which led to this error:\r\n\r\nUpdate: The issue exist also when navigating to a page that has \r\n```javascript\r\n...\r\n  <script\r\n        async\r\n        src=' '\r\n        type='application/ld+json'\r\n        dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: JSON.stringify(jsonLd) }}\r\n      />\r\n...\r\n```\r\nusing nextjs Link or router.push().\r\n\r\n<img width=\"883\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-06-07 at 19 09 17\" src=\"https://github.com/facebook/react/assets/3524687/b0fc4da4-a439-4ac7-8e04-14ef24cd8449\">\r\n\r\nIt seems react is trying to create a missing dom element during hydration (I might be wrong) and in the process `setInitialProperties` is called with a wrong parameter - `link`  instead of `script`\r\n\r\n```\r\n        instance = ownerDocument.createElement('script');\r\n        markNodeAsHoistable(instance);\r\n        setInitialProperties(instance, 'link', scriptProps);\r\n        (ownerDocument.head: any).appendChild(instance);\r\n```\r\n\r\nReact version: 19.0.0-beta-26f2496093-20240514\r\n\r\n## Steps To Reproduce\r\nScenario 1\r\n1. clone the repo\r\n2. npm i && npm run dev\r\n3. `git checkout main`\r\n4. navigate to http://localhost:3000\r\nThe loading screen is shown for 2 seconds. After that the page freeze and the error is shown in the console. The tab might snap in a bit because of it will run out of memery.\r\n\r\nScenario 2\r\n1. clone the repo\r\n2. npm i && npm run dev\r\n3. `git checkout navigation-example`\r\n4. navigate to http://localhost:3000\r\n5. click 'Test Page' link\r\nThe page hangs right away with the same error in console\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't\r\n  have dependencies other than React.

Create a hook, e.g. `function useYada() { return {} as any; }` \r\n2. Configure eslint `react-hooks/exhaustive-deps` rule with `[\"warn\", { additionalHooks: \"(useYada)\" }]`.\r\n3. Call the hook e.g. `useYada()` and receive the warning that `React Hook useYada received a function whose dependencies are unknown. Pass an inline function instead`.\r\n4. If you pass ONE argument, no warning is received. If you pass zero or two arguments to the hook, the warning is received.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't\r\n  have dependencies other than React.

This might be the reason why the parser does not throw an error, while RC cannot handle it (and BuildHIR doesn't know anything about that).\r\nI also tried upgrading babel oin the entire project, but that seems to be not as trivial as I'd thought. Maybe there is a different solution.\n\n### How often does this bug happen?\n\nEvery time\n\n### What version of React are you using?\n\n19",

It works by accessing `import.meta.env.VITE_VAR_NAME`. The react compiler does not seem to handle these expressions:\r\n```js\r\nfunction a() {\r\n  return import.meta.env;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSince react-compiler cannot know to what value _anything_ on the `import.meta` object resolves, it should just be passed down, resulting in the same code.\r\n\r\nNote:\r\nI tried to implement support for it, but I'm not able to test it aside from running it in the playground:\r\nhttps://github.com/facebook/react/compare/main...nikeee:react:meta-property?expand=1\r\n\r\nThe test runner does not support anything related to `import`, since the code must be executed as a module, which is not possible in `eval`.\r\n\n\n### How often does this bug happen?\n\nEvery time\n\n### What version of React are you using?\n\n19",

Please test using the latest version of the relevant\r\n  React packages to make sure your issue has not already been fixed.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nReact version: 18.0.0\r\n\r\n## Steps To Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Use the latest version of Safari (for me it's Version 17.5 (19618.2.12.11.6)). This behavior doesn't occur for chrome/firefox.\r\n2. Create an svg layout with any two markers, and a path element\r\n3. Change the marker reference for `marker-end` of the path element from the first marker to the second one via a render cycle (in my example, triggered by setState)\r\n4. Notice how the render cycle (\"turn blue\" in my code example) doesn't change the marker end \r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't\r\n  have dependencies other than React. Issues without reproduction steps or\r\n  code examples may be immediately closed as not actionable.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nLink to code example:\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  Please provide a CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new), a link to a\r\n  repository on GitHub, or provide a minimal code example that reproduces the\r\n  problem. You may provide a screenshot of the application if you think it is\r\n  relevant to your bug report. Here are some tips for providing a minimal\r\n  example: https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve.\r\n-->\r\n[code-sandbox-link](https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/gallant-gagarin-9hmvgt?file=%2Fsrc%2FApp.js%3A32%2C25&layout=%257B%2522sidebarPanel%2522%253A%2522EXPLORER%2522%252C%2522rootPanelGroup%2522%253A%257B%2522direction%2522%253A%2522horizontal%2522%252C%2522contentType%2522%253A%2522UNKNOWN%2522%252C%2522type%2522%253A%2522PANEL_GROUP%2522%252C%2522id%2522%253A%2522ROOT_LAYOUT%2522%252C%2522panels%2522%253A%255B%257B%2522type%2522%253A%2522PANEL_GROUP%2522%252C%2522contentType%2522%253A%2522UNKNOWN%2522%252C%2522direction%2522%253A%2522vertical%2522%252C%2522id%2522%253A%2522clwtnd7iv00063b5vjlkvr6uc%2522%252C%2522sizes%2522%253A%255B100%252C0%255D%252C%2522panels%2522%253A%255B%257B%2522type%2522%253A%2522PANEL_GROUP%2522%252C%2522contentType%2522%253A%2522EDITOR%2522%252C%2522direction%2522%253A%2522horizontal%2522%252C%2522id%2522%253A%2522EDITOR%2522%252C%2522panels%2522%253A%255B%257B%2522type%2522%253A%2522PANEL%2522%252C%2522contentType%2522%253A%2522EDITOR%2522%252C%2522id%2522%253A%2522clwtnd7iv00023b5viontqixi%2522%257D%255D%257D%252C%257B%2522type%2522%253A%2522PANEL_GROUP%2522%252C%2522contentType%2522%253A%2522SHELLS%2522%252C%2522direction%2522%253A%2522horizontal%2522%252C%2522id%2522%253A%2522SHELLS%2522%252C%2522panels%2522%253A%255B%257B%2522type%2522%253A%2522PANEL%2522%252C%2522contentType%2522%253A%2522SHELLS%2522%252C%2522id%2522%253A%2522clwtnd7iv00033b5vnt98kx96%2522%257D%255D%252C%2522sizes%2522%253A%255B100%255D%257D%255D%257D%252C%257B%2522type%2522%253A%2522PANEL_GROUP%2522%252C%2522contentType%2522%253A%2522DEVTOOLS%2522%252C%2522direction%2522%253A%2522vertical%2522%252C%2522id%2522%253A%2522DEVTOOLS%2522%252C%2522panels%2522%253A%255B%257B%2522type%2522%253A%2522PANEL%2522%252C%2522contentType%2522%253A%2522DEVTOOLS%2522%252C%2522id%2522%253A%2522clwtnd7iv00053b5vm8zm54ta%2522%257D%255D%252C%2522sizes%2522%253A%255B100%255D%257D%255D%252C%2522sizes%2522%253A%255B50%252C50%255D%257D%252C%2522tabbedPanels%2522%253A%257B%2522clwtnd7iv00023b5viontqixi%2522%253A%257B%2522tabs%2522%253A%255B%257B%2522id%2522%253A%2522clwtnd7iv00013b5vgoukubkr%2522%252C%2522mode%2522%253A%2522permanent%2522%252C%2522type%2522%253A%2522FILE%2522%252C%2522filepath%2522%253A%2522%252Fsrc%252Findex.js%2522%252C%2522state%2522%253A%2522IDLE%2522%257D%252C%257B%2522id%2522%253A%2522clwto3bed00023b5ul8p90qad%2522%252C%2522mode%2522%253A%2522permanent%2522%252C%2522type%2522%253A%2522FILE%2522%252C%2522initialSelections%2522%253A%255B%257B%2522startLineNumber%2522%253A32%252C%2522startColumn%2522%253A25%252C%2522endLineNumber%2522%253A32%252C%2522endColumn%2522%253A25%257D%255D%252C%2522filepath%2522%253A%2522%252Fsrc%252FApp.js%2522%252C%2522state%2522%253A%2522IDLE%2522%257D%255D%252C%2522id%2522%253A%2522clwtnd7iv00023b5viontqixi%2522%252C%2522activeTabId%2522%253A%2522clwto3bed00023b5ul8p90qad%2522%257D%252C%2522clwtnd7iv00053b5vm8zm54ta%2522%253A%257B%2522tabs%2522%253A%255B%257B%2522id%2522%253A%2522clwtnd7iv00043b5vgji5ysdn%2522%252C%2522mode%2522%253A%2522permanent%2522%252C%2522type%2522%253A%2522UNASSIGNED_PORT%2522%252C%2522port%2522%253A0%252C%2522path%2522%253A%2522%252F%2522%257D%255D%252C%2522id%2522%253A%2522clwtnd7iv00053b5vm8zm54ta%2522%252C%2522activeTabId%2522%253A%2522clwtnd7iv00043b5vgji5ysdn%2522%257D%252C%2522clwtnd7iv00033b5vnt98kx96%2522%253A%257B%2522tabs%2522%253A%255B%255D%252C%2522id%2522%253A%2522clwtnd7iv00033b5vnt98kx96%2522%257D%257D%252C%2522showDevtools%2522%253Atrue%252C%2522showShells%2522%253Afalse%252C%2522showSidebar%2522%253Atrue%252C%2522sidebarPanelSize%2522%253A15%257D)\r\n\r\n## Quick workaround\r\n\r\nI found if you reset the key during the render cycle (i.e. `key={isBlue}` in the path element), the mount/unmount will cause the svg to render properly",

Run either:\r\n    - `yarn build-for-devtools-dev`\r\n    - `yarn build-for-devtools-prod`\r\n\r\n4. Observe the output of the `shouldSkipBundle` function logs within the `build.js` script.\r\n\r\n## Link to code example:\r\n\r\n* Relevant code: `scripts/rollup/build.js`\r\n* Relevant function: `shouldSkipBundle`\r\n\r\n## The current behavior:\r\n\r\nThe `shouldSkipBundle` function, responsible for determining whether to include a bundle in the build output, contains incorrect logic for filtering when multiple bundle types are specified.  Specifically, the following line causes the issue:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n  const isAskingForDifferentType = requestedBundleTypes.every(\r\n    requestedType => bundleType.indexOf(requestedType) === -1\r\n  );\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis code uses `Array.prototype.every` with `indexOf` to check if **all** requested bundle types are missing in the current bundle type. However, when multiple types are specified, it should skip a bundle only if **none** of the requested types are present.\r\n\r\nHere's an example of the incorrect behavior observed during debugging:\r\n\r\n```\r\nrequestedBundleTypes [ 'NODE', 'NODE_DEV' ]\r\nbundleType NODE_DEV\r\nisAskingForDifferentType false\r\n\r\nrequestedBundleTypes [ 'NODE', 'NODE_DEV' ]\r\nbundleType NODE_PROD\r\nisAskingForDifferentType false // Incorrect behavior\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this case, even though the `bundleType` is `NODE_PROD` and doesn't include `NODE_DEV`, `isAskingForDifferentType` is incorrectly evaluated as `false`, leading to the bundle not being skipped.\r\n\r\n## The expected behavior:\r\n\r\nThe `shouldSkipBundle` function should correctly filter bundles based on multiple requested types. In the example above, the expected behavior is that `isAskingForDifferentType` should be `true` for the `NODE_PROD` bundle type, as it does not include the `NODE_DEV` type.\r\n\r\nIn general, the function should return `true` (skip the bundle) only if **none** of the requested types are included in the current bundle type.\r\n",

Run either:\r\n    - `yarn build-for-devtools-dev`\r\n    - `yarn build-for-devtools-prod`\r\n\r\n**Link to code example:**\r\n\r\n- Relevant code: `scripts/rollup/build.js` (line 72)\r\n- Relevant function: `parseRequestedNames`\r\n\r\n**The current behavior:**\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/facebook/react/assets/111031253/80d3b45c-d93d-4ffe-a801-c4494582f14f\r\n\r\nWhen running the commands `yarn build-for-devtools-dev` or `yarn build-for-devtools-prod`, a `TypeError` is thrown: `names[i].split is not a function`. This is evident in the provided screenshot. The error originates from the `parseRequestedNames` function in `scripts/rollup/build.js`.\r\n\r\nThe problem stems from how the `argv.type` value is handled. In these specific commands, `argv.type` is passed as an array (e.g., `['NODE', 'NODE_DEV']`), but the code incorrectly wraps it in another array:\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\nconst requestedBundleTypes = argv.type\r\n  ? parseRequestedNames([argv.type], 'uppercase') // Incorrect wrapping\r\n  : [];\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `parseRequestedNames` function then attempts to apply the `.split(',')` method to each element of `names`, expecting them to be strings. However, due to the erroneous wrapping, it encounters an array instead, leading to the TypeError.\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\nfunction parseRequestedNames(names, toCase) {\r\n  let result = [];\r\n  for (let i = 0; i < names.length; i++) {\r\n    let splitNames = names[i].split(',');\r\n    for (let j = 0; j < splitNames.length; j++) {\r\n      let name = splitNames[j].trim();\r\n      if (!name) {\r\n        continue;\r\n      }\r\n      if (toCase === 'uppercase') {\r\n        name = name.toUpperCase();\r\n      } else if (toCase === 'lowercase') {\r\n        name = name.toLowerCase();\r\n      }\r\n      result.push(name);\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n  return result;\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n**The expected behavior:**\r\n\r\nThe `yarn build-for-devtools-dev` or `yarn build-for-devtools-prod` commands should run without errors. The `argv.type` value should be handled correctly even when passed as an array, and bundle type filtering should work as expected.\r\n\r\n**Additional information:**\r\n\r\n- The `yarn build` or `yarn build-for-devtools` commands work without issues because the `argv.type` value is passed as a string or undefined.\r\n- The `parseRequestedNames` function generates `requestedBundleTypes` and `requestedBundleNames` arrays based on the provided names (`argv.type` or `argv._`). These arrays are used for bundle filtering in the `shouldSkipBundle` function.",

The state only changed after the action completed.  I'm not sure if this something a bug or a rule must be followed.  It seems a bit surprising.\r\n\r\nLet's say a naive component like this.\r\n\r\n```tsx\r\nfunction Demo() {\r\n  const [state, setState] = useState(\"A\");\r\n\r\n  const [, submitAction, isPending] = useActionState(async () => {\r\n    setState(\"B\")\r\n    await sleep(60 * 1000)\r\n    setState(\"C\")\r\n  }, null);\r\n\r\n  return (\r\n    <form action={submitAction}>\r\n      <span>{x}</span>\r\n      <button type=\"submit\">Submit</button>\r\n    </form>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOne will only see the value `A` and continue seeing value `A` from a minutes after submission, then they will see `C`.  Value `B` was never printed on the screen.\r\n\r\nThis seems not really related to the hook but the form `action` prop. What I want to do is to trigger some async validation before I call the api from the `action`.  Sometimes, the validation resulted a warning that I want the component to enter a \"confirmation\" state, but I cannot do anything if the action is triggered by the action prop.  \r\n ",
